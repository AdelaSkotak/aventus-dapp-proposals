## Aventus DApp Proposal Standard
The Aventus DApp Proposal Standard is the standard to which all competition entries should adhere. The purpose of it is to ensure a minimum quality standard in entries, and a selection of information about a proposal that makes it easy for the public and the judging panel to understand and evaluate it relative to other proposals in a fair and complete manner, judging its overall utility for the ecosystem.

All proposals should be structured as follows:

1. **Name:** The name of the proposed application idea.
2. **Purpose:** The purpose of the proposed application idea. This can be something resembling a unique value proposition, a few word description, a brief sentence explaining the problem it solves, etc. Let the reader know exactly what is coming.
3. **Description:** A full description of what the application is and how it will work. You should try to answer the following:
    * The problem you are solving: why does this idea matter in the real world?
    * How will this idea benefit the Aventus ecosystem? How will it utilise the Aventus protocol? 
    * What part of the ticketing lifecycle will your solution tackle? Primary sales, secondary sales, event creation, etc?
    * What is your solution, in simple words?
    * How will your solution work?
    * Who will use your solution? Is it a ticketing agent, an event organiser, an artist, etc.
    * What value does your solution have for said customer?
